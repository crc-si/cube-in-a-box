 * Index a default region with `make index` 
 * Edit the Makefile to change the region of interest
 * You can set up the Dashboard using `make prepare-dashboard`

# Deploying to AWS:
To deploy to AWS, you cam either do it on the command line, with the AWS command line installed or the magic URL below and the AWS console.

## Magic URL
[Launch a Cube in a Box](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/new?stackName=cube-in-a-box&templateURL=https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cubeinabox/opendatacube-test.yml)

## Command line
 * Alter the parameters in the [parameters.json](./parameters.json) file
 * Run `make create-infra`
 * If you want to change the stack, you can do `make update-infra` (although it may be cleaner to delete and re-create the stack)

# IMPORTANT NOTES
In your local environment, in order to be able to get data from S3, you need to ensure that the environment variables `ODC_ACCESS_KEY` and `ODC_SECRET_KEY` are set to something valid.

This is a change for felix to review!
